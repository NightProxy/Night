# **Deploy to Netlify**

1. Go to [Github](https://github.com) and click sign up.

2. Once your account is made, fork our github.

3. Next go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)

4. Create a account and make sure to link it to __Github.__
5. Next click on `sites` within Netlify and then click on `Add new site` and `Import an existing project`

6. Click on deploy with Github.

7. Scroll to find the fork of Night you made earlier. When you find it, click it. 

8. Next a page will pull up with some information that you probably don't know about. Ignore all of it and scroll to the bottom. Click `Deploy (fork name)`

9. Wait for the github to finish building. But while you're waiting, go to `Site Configuration` under your site link and a couple other information. 

10. Under `General`, click on Site details, then click `Change site name`

11. Change the domain name to whatever you want, but make sure to give us __100%__ credit in your Git fork or something. Click `Save` and close out the menu. 

12. Next click on the link that was generated below `Configuration for (name of domain)`

13. And you're done. Make sure to keep your Github updated with the most recent versions of Night.
